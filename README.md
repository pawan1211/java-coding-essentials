# java-coding-essentials


A collection of concise, console‑based Java programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as conditional logic, loops, collections, and exception handling. Each problem is isolated in its own source file for clarity and ease of testing.

## ✨ Problems Overview

| Problem | Concept Highlights | Brief Description |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **1 – Calculator** | `switch` statements, exception handling, user input | A class‑based calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two `double` values provided at runtime. |
| **2 – Odd Series (Fixed Length)** | loops, list building | Prints the first **_a_** odd numbers where **_a_** is supplied by the user. |
| **3 – Odd Series (Up to Value)** | loops, conditional logic | Prints every odd number ≤ **_a_** when **_a_** is odd, or up to **_a – 1_** when **_a_** is even. |
| **4 – Multiples Counter** | nested loops, maps | Counts how many integers in a user‑supplied list are divisible by each digit 1 through 9. |
